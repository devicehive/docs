## 1. Create

Create an instance of DeviceHive cloud to connect your Things to Apps. This can be:

- [Playground](http://playground.devicehive.com/)
- [Docker-compose](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-docker/tree/master/rdbms-image)
- [Manual installation](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java-server/wiki/Getting-started)

## 2. Connect

Connect any device via REST API, WebSockets or MQTT. The DeviceHive team supports libraries written in various programming languages, including Java, Node.js and Python client libraries which make the platform device-agnostic. You can even connect such low-end wi-fi enabled devices as [ESP8266](doc:chip-in-the-cloud-esp8266) .

## 3. Visualize

Attach Grafana UI to fetch real time data from your data source and create your own dashboard with different gauges, graphs, text meters and many more: <https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-grafana-datasource>

# Try It!
