For convenience, DeviceHive supports an optional Javascript Admin Console to manage the server and devices.

The dashboard provides a GUI to manage users, networks and devices. Additionally, you can use it to monitor and send device commands and notifications.

The application and instructions can be found at <https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-admin-console>, and it is also installed with the DeviceHive Docker container.
